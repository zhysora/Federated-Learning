# Federated-LearningWe implement the paper [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629). Its blog is [here](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html).We wish to explore several possible approaches:1. server pulling gradient update from clients;2. clients eagerly train and push updates to server;3. extend to multi-server; servers gossip to sync;4. client-only p2p gradient updates
